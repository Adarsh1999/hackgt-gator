VR Board

Goal: Reimaging virtual education, providing educators a virtual whiteboard to make teaching easier (gets rid of the inconveniences of screen sharing paint applications when drawing out concepts). Future plans for this concept is to integrate into zoom classroom sessions.

Features:
1) NLP Speech to Text to capture educator’s voice, render drawings to screen on keywords (i.e. draw circle, draw rectangle, draw arrow)
2) Handtrack.js to capture educator’s gestures to draw shapes on the screen when the educator is trying to teach a concept (i.e. physics problems, free body diagrams [vector arrows, rectangles for objects, circles for gaussian surfaces])
